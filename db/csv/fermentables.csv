Recommended for Bamberg-style Rauchbier and other smoked beers, porters, Oktoberfests, and Scottish ale.

Kölsch Malt - 4.5°L (Schill),1.037,4.5,"From a maltster co-op based in Osthofen, near Köln, this malt is used by some of the brewpubs in that city to make their trademark ale. Kölsch malt has a light, sweet and extremely ""German"" flavor and aroma with a little bit of biscuit character. We've had good results using a multi-temp step mash with Kölsch malt, but a single infusion — although not traditional — works as well. Style nerds please take note: the maltster rates the color of this malt at 9 EBC. If you use 100% Kölsch malt for the grist of a Kölsch, you will be within spec according to Eric Warner's Kölsch (7-14 EBC, or 3.5-7 SRM — p. 51), but definitely on the dark end of the BJCP guidelines. If you are brewing for a competition, you may want to incorporate some pils or wheat malt into the grain bill to dilute the color."
Maris Otter – 4°L (Crisp),1.038,4,"This variety has long been a favorite of English brewers for its rich flavor and very forgiving brewing performance. Since this malt is fully modified, a protein rest is not necessary. This is a very popular base malt used in pale ales, bitters, porters, IPAs, stouts, barleywines and Scottish ales.

Midnight Wheat - 550°L (Briess),1.025,550,A very dark roasted malt that provides body with very smooth and mild roasted flavor along with intense color. This malt won't add the bitterness or astringency of other roasted malts like Chocolate or Black Malt. Made from Wisconsin wheat.
Munich - 8.3°L (Best Malz),1.035,8.3,"High-kilned lager malt contributes an intense malt flavor and amber color. Use up to 100% for alt, dunkel, and bock; smaller percentages in pale or amber lagers and ales for enhanced malt character."
Munich - 10°L (Briess),1.035,10,"Munich-style malt that contributes a very robust, malty flavor when used at 5-15%. Well suited for contributing additional malty flavor in all beer styles."

"Oats, Golden Naked - 10°L (Simpsons)",1.037,10,"This unique product has a sweet berry-nut flavor. Used at a rate of 4-15% to add a deep golden hue, light caramel flavors, and a creamy, satiny finish."

Peat Smoked Malt - 2.5°L (Simpsons),1.034,2.5,"Phenol level 12-24. While the malt is in the kiln, peat moss outside the kiln is gently smoked over slow burning coals allowing its vapors to drift above the malt. Peat malt is used in the distilling of Scotland's finest whiskies, but has found favor with homebrewers and craft brewers in smoked beers. Adds intense iodine and seaweed smoke phenol character - a little goes a long way!"
