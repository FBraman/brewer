Yeast starter,"Depending on the gravity of the batch, you may choose to do a yeast starter. There is a theoretical ""best"" amount of yeast to pitch. And, the comercial packages you buy are generally below this level."
Measure water,"Depending on your equipment, how you split up your water beforehand can vary greatly. Brew in a bag (BIAB) will generally be one vessel of all your water that serves as mash/lauter tun, hot liquour tank and boil kettle. Just make sure you have a little extra the first few times, because you don't want to be trying to dechorinate water when you need it."
Clean and sanitize,"These are two separate processes, cleaning removes organic material that can harbor undesireable microbes. Sanitiziing kills (almost) all the remaining microbes after organic material has been removed. Sanitizing without cleaning properly will give unsatisfactory results. Anything on the 'hot' side does not need to be sanitized as the boiling will effectively sanitize. Sanitizing is not the same thing as sterilizing (sterilizing removes microbes to a higher degree and needs temperatures higher than 212 or chemicals that are rather harsh)."
Heat water,"Heat the strike water, always have a little extra hot water and cold water for adjusting mash temperatures."
Dough in,"Mix your crushed grain with strike water to attain mash temp. Most people stir the crushed grains slowly into the strike water, but it is a matter of preference. Stir as you go to avoid dough balls. Remember that it can take 10 minutes for mash temp to stablilize. Add your extra hot or cold water judiciously to adjust as need be. A good crush on your grains is necessary for best mash efficiency (the proper conversion of starches into sugars) and extract efficiency (the ability to rinse those sugars out of the grains during lauter)."
Mash,"Most homebrewers will use what's called a single infusion mash. Mashing at one temperature (between 149 and 158) that represents a compromise between all the 'best' temperatures for different enzyme actions, usually about an hour. Higher mash temperatures will generally give you more redisdual sugar (sweeter beers) than lower temperatures (drier, less sweet beers). Try to maintain the temperature as best as possible, a 1 degree F shift will not make a significant difference, but a 5 degree miss will probably efffect your beer significantly. Giving the mash a stir every 15- 20 minutes is a good idea to distribute the heat and get an accurate temperature reading.  Ph is important. most people will do fine with an amber or brown ale with whatever water they have. There is an ideal ph range for mashing, and it is only possible to calculate mash ph with BOTH your local water chemistry report and your grist composition. Roughly, darker malts will decrease your ph (increaste acidity) more than pale malts. In other words, an all pale malt beer with harder water may not reach the proper mash ph resulting in poor tasting beer with low surgar extraction. Historically, areas with harder water tended to brew darker beers. Keep in mind that there are many mashing strategies for different desired results or grains. Mashing alone is worth several books as a topic. Explore step mashes and decoctions as your confidence grows."
Conversion test,"Not necessary, but hey, it's fun and you need to lift that lid to stir anyway. Place a few drops of wort on a white plate, put a drop of iodine (or the undiluted sanitizer iodophor) into the wort. If it turns black, it means starch is still present and you do not have full conversion of starches to sugars, otherwise you have wort!  "
Mashout,"An optional but useful step. Raising mash temperatures to around 170F (but not above) will halt the conversion process and keep the sugars in a ""looser"" state. This allows them to be rinsed from the grains more easily in the lauter. Rember that going above 170F with grain present is generally a bad idea as it can promote tannin extraction."
Recirculation,"If you have a 'traditional' lauter tun, it can be benenficial to recirculate the wort to 'set the grain bed' before running off into the kettle. Capture the first few quarts of run-off and gently pour back on top of the grain bed, until the wort runs relatively clear. This will act as a filter providing clearer wort going into the kettle."
Lauter,"Sparging is to add water to the lauter tun as you run off into the kettle. Generally, there is batch sparging, where the water is added in a batch and then run off, or fly sparging, where water is added to the lauter tun at the same rate it is drawn off. BIAB skips most of this nonsense and avoids the dreaded stuck sparge, where grains become impacted and unable to runn off properly.Separate your spent grains from the sweeter things in life. If you 'brew in a bag' (BIAB) you just lift that basket out and let the wort drain from the spent grain. You may also choose to pour some water over the basket as with a sparge in three vessel. However, over doing it can extract extra tannins if the temperature gets too high (never sparge above 170F) and the remaining sugar level gets too low (below 1.008). There is much debate about what is ""best."" I recommend attempting to get aournd 75% extraction efficiency and then experimenting to find your joy. In lower gravity beers, it is possible to oversparge, where sugar content is low enough that ph will rise, allowing for tannin extraction. However, if temperatures are kept below 170, this is not likely. In higher gravity beers, it is possible to reach your ideal preboil volume but still have a lot of sugar left in the grain. Ways of over coming this are to sparge more (remove more sugar) but boil longer to remove the extra water. That can exceed the limits of your equipment due to larger volumes or the limits of your patience with longer boiling times. It can also exceed the ability of your heating capacity to boil a large volume of water (especially if you are on a stove top). You can also add more grain to the recipe, knowing that your efficiency is going to go down more slowly than the extra sugars will be removed. Of course, you can also add malt extract directly to your kettle after/during sparging to make up the difference in desired gravity. "
Boil,"Once the volume and extraction targets have been met bring your wort up to boil as fast as possible. If you are on a stove top, this may be slower than optimal. The faster and harder it reaches a boil the better the hot break, where haze causing proteins clump together and percipitate. However, it also promotes boil over, so be careful. Tricks for dealing with a boil over include a fan, stirring and a cold water spray bottle. "
Hop additions,"As the boil progresses, add your hops at designated times, generally there will be a bittering charge at the beginning, a ""flavor"" charge near the end and and an aroma charge right at the end when you turn off the burner. Of course, like everything else, the sky is the limit for innovation and experimentation. Many add hops as soon as the wort beggins to hit the boil kettle (first wort hopping) some save all the hop additions for towards the end of the boil (hop bursting) and just add lots of extra to make up for the loss of bittering efficiency. All have strategies have their pros and cons."
Chilling,"After the wort has been boiled the desired amount of time, it is time to chill it down to temperatures where yeast thrive ( and maybe a little below). Bringing the temperature down fast will aid in cold break, where some haze causing protiens will clump together and percipitate out of solution. Strategies include an imersion chiller, a heat transfer coil, of copper or stainless steel that is placed into the wort and coolant is run through (usually water). A counter flow chiller, or a plate chiller are harder to clean but more efficient heat exchangers. Of course, you can always defualt to the classic placing your whole kettle in a bath of ice water, if your kettle is small enough, you are strong enough and your sink is big enough. Some have been experiementing with 'no-chill' and debate rages over the possible problems with this (ranging from off flavors to contamination, though many report success).  Once the wort gets below 170 or so, it is vitally important that nothing unsanitized will touch it. Before the boil, it does not matter much, but after the boil, you will risk contamination and poor flavor (or worse, a dumpable batch, so sad...). While chilling is a good time to make sure your fermenter and all transfer equipment (already cleaned right?) are sanitized. If you need to rehydrate your yeast, now is a good time."
Transfer,"move the chilled wort into the fermentation vessel. Usually by gravity, though many use sanitized pumps successfully. If using a counter flow chiller or plate chiller, a pump is all but necessary."
Aerate,"Yeast need oxygen for proper growth. Ideally you will want between 8-12ppm for most average gravity beers. Thankfully, gently shaking the fermentation vessel can get you where you need to be. Higher gravity beers may benefit from higher oxygen levels but you will need special equipment to get the oxygen into solution (like an oxygen tank with a diffusion stone attached). Some people use an aquarium pump or air compressor with an inline hepa filter."
Pitch yeast,Get that yeast starter/packets into your wort. A sanitized funnel is a common method. Save a little wort to rinse it down.
Ferment,"Cover that vessel so that it is protected from outside contamination, but make sure the carbon dioxide produced by fermentation can escape as with an airlock. Remember to control temperature. This cannot be overstated. Yeast flavor profiles are extremely temperature dependent. Higher temps tend to favor esters (fruitier flavors) lower tend to favor phenols (think clove). However, every yeast has ideal ranges for its desired flavor profile. Keep in mind, fermentation is exothermic (heat generating). A tub with water for thermal ballast (with a spare ice bottle or two) can work quite well. However, many will gravitate to more serious and fine tuned temerature control with a dorm refrigerator and temperature controller. "
Check gravity,"There are a million fermentation paths and many reasons that things may seem off but be fine. If you are wondering if your beer is done fermenting, there is only one way to confirm and that is to check the remaining sugars in solution (gravity) with a hydrometer. In fact, doing a couple of times a few days apart is best to make sure fermentation is not still progressing, albeit slowly."
Package,"Choose your battle. Bottles are classic, you add a little more (carefully measured) sugar and referment in the bottle to produce carbon dioxide and carbonate your beer! It is vitally important to confirm that the beer is finished fermenting. Allowing beer to overcarbonate in bottles can produce bottle bombs which are dangerous.  Kegs are nice, put the beer into the keg and put it under pressure from a co2 tank for a week or two and you have carbonated beer. The consistency and convenince of dispensing are high, but so is the buy in cost."
